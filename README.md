# Windows NT Legacy NT6 Installer

---

## üß† What is it?

**Windows NT Legacy NT6 Installer** is a custom Windows PE-based setup environment that allows you to install legacy versions of Windows NT‚Äî**Windows NT 3.51**, **Windows NT 4.0**, and **Windows 2000**‚Äîon modern systems using the Windows 10 (NT 6.x) setup infrastructure. Windows 2000 is installed with the Windows 10 setup, and Windows NT 3.51 and Windows NT 4.0 are installed with DISM.

This tool is designed to **bypass the traditional text-mode setup phase**, offering a modernized, semi-automated deployment method using `.WIM` images and basic DISKPART scripting.
